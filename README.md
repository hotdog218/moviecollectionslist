# A Centralized List of Movie Collections
This is basically just a large list of movie collections. It's going to look a lot more pretty [over at the google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15aSfgW7OadL1c_sNCmxEE9HhDejdYCe3BjMWrh6Jh3s/edit#gid=0). Additionally the Google Sheet can be copied and used with [this script](https://github.com/michaelvitucci1/movie_list_collections) to automatically sort the collections into your Plex library.

Feel free to contribute. I put this on GitHub so more people would be able to find it. The google sheet is probably going to be more up to date, but I will try to keep this up to date as well.
